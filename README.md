After installation, use the package to interact with Letsdial's API. Here's an example:

```python

# Example: Initiate a call
call_id = start_call(
    from_number="+1234567890",
    to_number="+1987654321",
    call_plan="Standard",
    duration=10  # Duration in minutes
)

print(f"Call started! Call ID: {call_id}")

# Example: Fetch call details
details = get_call_details(call_id)
print(f"Call Details: {details}")
